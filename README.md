# Ships

## Idea

This little game that I've planned, is an idea that I already realised as a boardgame that's more or less playable. The only prolem is, it's a little bit frustrating because you
have to make a lot of Calculations in your head. Because of that I thought that it would be a great Idea to realise this game in a programming language. I've chosen Python with pygame
to do the Job.
